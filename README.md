# sandwich_maker

<b>Intent</b><br>
Inspired by my favorite online series, this program is designed to be a randomized sandwich maker. It blends random ingredient selection and personalized sandwiches, benefitting users who are indecisive at lunchtime or wanting to try something new

<b>Design</b><br>
* Programs randomized ingredient selection of all parts of a sandwich (bread, cheese, protein, vegetables, etc.)<br>
* Allows users to assemble sandwiches with up to 6 randomly generated<br>
